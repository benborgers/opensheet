# Cloudflare Workers vs Bun on Railway - Key Differences

## Architecture Comparison

### Current (Cloudflare Workers)
```
Request → Worker (BILLED) → Cache API → Google Sheets
         ↑
    Every request counted, even cache hits
```

### New (Bun on Railway + Cloudflare CDN)
```
Request → Cloudflare CDN (FREE) → Railway (BILLED only on cache miss) → Google Sheets
         ↑                        ↑
    95%+ cached (free)        Only 5% hit Railway
```

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Workers | Railway + CDN | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Cost (600M req/mo)** | $180+/mo | $5-10/mo | **94% savings** |
| **Caching** | Cache API (still billed) | CDN (free) | Huge difference |
| **Global edge** | ✅ 275+ locations | ✅ Via Cloudflare CDN | Same performance |
| **Cold starts** | ❌ None | ⚠️ Possible* | Railway keeps warm |
| **Deploy time** | ~30 sec | ~1-2 min | Slightly slower |
| **Debugging** | Logs in dashboard | Railway logs + local | Easier debugging |
| **Analytics** | D1 database | Railway analytics | Different tools |
| **Vendor lock-in** | High (Workers-specific) | Low (standard Node/Bun) | More portable |
| **Scaling** | Automatic | Automatic | Both handle traffic |
| **Max response time** | 50ms CPU limit | No limit | More flexibility |

*Railway typically keeps apps warm on paid plans with consistent traffic

## Code Differences

### Minimal Changes Required

**Worker code:**
```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Worker-specific API
    const cache = caches.default;
    await cache.match(request);
    ctx.waitUntil(promise);
  }
}
```

**Railway/Bun code:**
```javascript
Bun.serve({
  async fetch(request) {
    // Standard Fetch API
    // No caching code needed (CDN handles it)
    // Use Cache-Control headers instead
  }
});
```

**Key differences:**
1. ✅ No `env` context (use process.env instead)
2. ✅ No `ctx.waitUntil()` (not needed)
3. ✅ No Cache API calls (CDN handles caching)
4. ✅ Standard HTTP server instead of Worker export
5. ✅ Can run locally with `bun run server.ts`

## Migration Checklist

### Before Migration
- [x] Current Worker deployed and working
- [ ] 600M requests/month costing $180+
- [ ] Analytics tracking (optional - can rebuild later)

### Railway Setup
- [ ] Railway account created
- [ ] Railway CLI installed (`npm i -g @railway/cli`)
- [ ] Bun installed locally for testing
- [ ] GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable ready

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Railway (`railway up`)
- [ ] Test Railway URL directly
- [ ] Verify health check works
- [ ] Test actual spreadsheet endpoints
- [ ] Run `./test.sh https://your-app.up.railway.app`

### Cloudflare Configuration
- [ ] DNS record updated or CNAME created
- [ ] Proxy enabled (orange cloud)
- [ ] Cache Rule created for API routes
- [ ] Tested cache headers (`CF-Cache-Status: HIT`)
- [ ] Verified 30-second cache TTL

### Monitoring (First 48h)
- [ ] Check Railway request count
- [ ] Verify error rates are low (<0.1%)
- [ ] Compare response times to Worker
- [ ] Monitor Railway costs
- [ ] Check Cloudflare cache hit ratio

### Cleanup
- [ ] 48h+ of stable traffic
- [ ] No errors or issues
- [ ] Remove Worker route from wrangler.toml
- [ ] Archive Worker code (for rollback reference)
- [ ] Export D1 analytics if needed

## Performance Expectations

### Response Times

**Worker (current):**
- Cache hit: ~10-50ms
- Cache miss: ~200-500ms (Google Sheets API call)

**Railway + CDN (expected):**
- Cache hit: ~10-50ms (same - served from Cloudflare edge)
- Cache miss: ~250-600ms (slightly slower, but only 5% of requests)

### Cache Hit Ratio

With 30-second cache TTL:
- **Optimistic**: 95%+ (if traffic is steady)
- **Realistic**: 90-95% (accounting for variations)
- **Conservative**: 85-90% (during traffic spikes)

Even at 85% hit ratio, you save ~$165/month!

---

## Rollback Decision Points

**Rollback if:**
- ❌ Error rate >1% for >5 minutes
- ❌ Response times >2x Worker average
- ❌ Railway costs exceed $50/month
- ❌ Cache hit ratio <70%
- ❌ Any data corruption detected

**Continue if:**
- ✅ Error rate <0.1%
- ✅ Response times similar to Worker
- ✅ Railway costs $5-15/month
- ✅ Cache hit ratio >85%
- ✅ Users experience no issues

## Cost Breakdown

### Current Costs (Cloudflare Workers)

```
Base fee:              $5/mo
Requests (600M):       597M × $0.30/1M = $179.10
Total:                 $184.10/mo
```

### Projected Costs (Railway + CDN)

**Scenario 1: 95% cache hit ratio**
```
Railway (fixed):       $5-10/mo
Origin requests:       30M (only 5% hit Railway)
Cloudflare CDN:        $0 (free tier)
Total:                 $5-10/mo
Savings:               $174-179/mo (94-97% reduction)
```

**Scenario 2: 85% cache hit ratio (worst case)**
```
Railway (fixed):       $10-15/mo (slightly higher usage)
Origin requests:       90M (15% hit Railway)
Cloudflare CDN:        $0 (free tier)
Total:                 $10-15/mo
Savings:               $169-174/mo (92-94% reduction)
```

### Annual Savings
```
Monthly: $170
Annual:  $2,040
```

## FAQs

### Q: Will users notice any difference?
**A:** No. Cloudflare CDN serves from same edge locations as Workers. Response times will be identical for cached requests (95%+ of traffic).

### Q: What if Railway goes down?
**A:** Rollback to Workers in ~5 minutes by changing DNS. Keep Worker deployed for first 48h.

### Q: Do I need to change my API?
**A:** No. Same URLs, same response format, same behavior.

### Q: What about analytics (D1)?
**A:** Railway has built-in request analytics. For custom tracking, you can add logging or use external services.

### Q: Will this scale?
**A:** Yes. Cloudflare CDN handles 600M+ requests easily (free). Railway handles the ~30M origin requests (5%) with no issues.

### Q: What if traffic increases?
**A:** CDN caching is free regardless of volume. Railway scales automatically. Costs stay ~$5-15/mo even at 1B+ requests.
